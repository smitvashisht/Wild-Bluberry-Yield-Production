#### The dataset used for predictive modelling was generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model, which is an open-source, spatially-explicit computer simulation program, that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangement, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency and yield of the wild blueberry agro-ecosystem. The simulation model has been validated by the field observation and experimental data collected in Maine USA and Canadian Maritimes during the last 30 years and now is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for wild blueberry pollination researches. This simulated data provides researchers who have actual data collected from field observation and those who wants to experiment the potential of machine learning algorithms response to real data and computer simulation modelling generated data as input for crop yield prediction models.


Data and ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing

Performed data import and preprocessing on Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation data. Identified and dropped irrelevant columns ('Row#', 'MaxOfUpperTRange', 'MinOfUpperTRange', 'MaxOfLowerTRange', 'MinOfLowerTRange', 'RainingDays', 'honeybee'). Features like 'fruitmass', 'fruitset', and 'seeds' were excluded due to their derivative nature from the target variable.

üîò Feature Selection

Implemented feature selection using correlation-based (f_regression) and information gain (mutual_info_regression) methods to retain optimal features for modeling.

üß∞ Modelling

Trained and evaluated four regression models‚ÄîLinear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost‚Äîon selected features, achieving promising results with R-squared values ranging from 0.804 to 0.966.

üìä Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), showcasing robust performance, particularly with Random Forest and XGBoost models.

üîç Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimized model performance through GridSearchCV and RepeatedKFold cross-validation techniques, enhancing model accuracy and efficiency.

üìà Prediction and Evaluation

Identified the best-performing model, XGBoost, demonstrating strong predictive capability for yield estimation.
